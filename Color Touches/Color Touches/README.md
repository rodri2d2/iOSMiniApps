# Color Touches

This app changes the color of the main view base on how the screen is touched
1. Touch with one finger and move Y axis (top to bottom and vice versa) to change Red Color
2. Touch with two fingers and move Y axis (top to bottom and vice versa) to change Green Color
2. Touch with Three fingers and move Y axis (top to bottom and vice versa) to change Blue Color

## Goals

1. Improve UIView skills
2. Training how to read and understand the Apple's official documentation


## Big Trick
Following Apple documentation, theres an article on how to implement Multi-touch functionality

## Little problems
Until the last commit, the app does not detect the third touch correctly
